                <p>Our natural world and its wildlife depends upon storytelling. As the now famed quote from Sir David Attenborough goes… “No One Will Protect What They Don’t Care About; And No One Will Care About What They Have Never Experienced”.

                    It is certainly true that sharing the studies and stories of wildlife and nature is a vital part of inviting those outside of the conservation world to experience the moments of wonder and inspiration that continue to move us to protect it.</p>

            <div class="containerThree">
                <p>At the beginning of September, I launched The Wildlife Blogger Crowd; a growing community of nature and wildlife bloggers and storytellers from across the globe, supporting one another in sharing posts, ideas and messages — to help spread awareness of causes and passion for wildlife far and wide.

                    I’m delighted to say that, four months on, we have featured 100 incredible storytellers — all of which are doing amazing work, and certainly deserve a space to be showcased.</p>

                <h4>Addressing the ‘Elephant’ in the Room</h4>
                <p>The death of an elephant in Kerala has galvanised the nation and there have been clarion calls for ‘justice’. As the sentiment wears off, phrases like ‘fed’ and ‘hungry’ have disappeared from the reports. A clearer picture has subsequently emerged of the events that allegedly unfolded. It can now be said with some degree of certainty that the firecracker bomb was placed by a farmer to ward off wild boar from his crops. This blows the lid off the issue of human wildlife interface that is often presented fallaciously to urban Indians.</p>

                <h4>How a Water Heater Can Change and Save Lives</h4>
                <p>Bony and dishevelled, Kanta Kamde stands barefoot outside her house. I stand with her in silence, arms wrapped around my chest, gaze lowered. It feels like a condolence visit. Then she speaks, “We had run out of firewood. The cooking gas cylinder too was exhausted; we had not refilled it in a long time.”</p>

                <h4>Feral Dogs Vs. Wildlife – A Human-made Disaster in the Making</h4>
                <p>Nature’s laws of survival demand that predators feed on their prey. A tiger chasing a deer, a desert fox scanning the desert floor for spiny-tailed lizards, dhole bringing down a sambar stag. All normal scenarios playing out in the wildscape. But the picture gets skewed when a creature born of human influence such as the domestic dog appears on the scene. From the massive Tibetan wild ass in the Himalayas to one of the heaviest flying birds in the world, the critically endangered Great Indian Bustard in central and western India, are all falling prey to feral dogs that have taken over wild habitats, both protected and unprotected. This is a gross aberration of the natural food web design.</p>

                <h4>The Quintessential Vets</h4>
                <p>“Veterinarians are irrevocable generalists,” reads a line in the book Veterinary Anatomy and Physiology. While most people associate a veterinarian only with treatment and welfare of individual animals, their role extends to maintaining the health of wildlife populations and ecosystems at large. Be it wildlife research, rescue, rehabilitation, translocation, monitoring of infectious diseases, mortality investigation of animals, and more, a veterinarian is at the centre, orchestrating challenging and multi-sectoral interventions. Today, wildlife veterinarians are key to tackling a plethora of emerging and complex conservation challenges of our time, such as human-wildlife conflict and emerging diseases, yet they often lack training with respect to dealing with wildlife species and their diseases.</p>

                <h4>In Hostile Territory</h4>
                <p>As man-animal conflicts get increasingly common, Dr. Anish Andheria stresses the need for action and why there’s still hope for both sides.

                    Recently, I was part of a team investigating the death of a 21-year old tribal youth, presumably trampled by a wild elephant in Karnataka’s Nagarahole Tiger Reserve. The grieving family received Rs. 50,000 the next morning by the Forest Department with the promise of more money for the loss.</p>

                <h4>Illegal Wildlife Trade: The Need to Look Within</h4>
                <p>It is often said, in Newtonian fashion, that what goes up, must come down. While this adage may apply to many things in the modern era, sadly, it doesn’t hold entirely true for crimes against wildlife. It applies lesser still to the illegal trade of wildlife – an organised crime that is growing exponentially and today, is considered globally to be fourth only to arms, human, and drugs trafficking.

                    Like with many a societal ill, we assume that wildlife crime, particularly illegal wildlife trade (IWT), is not happening around us. We are given to believe and want to believe that it is a “foreign” problem. Reports on recent gargantuan seizures of wildlife contraband in countries like Singapore and Vietnam further this notion. However, the fact remains that while a large portion of India’s wildlife is hunted to meet the international demand for wild animal and plant-based products, a significant amount of hunting occurs due to localised, domestic reasons.</p>

                    <p>The mission of Global Rewilding Alliance is to help build the global rewilding movement with the aim to mainstream rewilding in science, policy and practice globally by 2030. The Alliance is a partnership of rewilding organisations, with 180+ Alliance Partners worldwide working across all continents. Together, they are currently helping to influence the rewilding of 2.2 million km2 of land and sea in 124 countries (an area greater than France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK combined)..</p>

                    <h4>Tiger Conservation-The Road Ahead</h4>
                    <p>It was 9.30 a.m. in May 2022, and the forest had already gone silent under the overpowering blaze of the sun. Just as our vehicle drove up a small but steep slope, leading to a large dike that encircled a medium-sized pool of water, I noticed a movement – it was a sub-adult male tiger about to settle down in a shaded patch smack in the middle of the dike. He glanced cursorily at our vehicle before looking away. After a five-minute grooming session, he stood up, stretched, and began walking along the dike away from us.</p>

                    <h4>Evolution of Green Grants in India – An Analysis of a Working Paper</h4>
                    <p>It is interesting to behold the pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial trajectory of forest governance in India. The forests have been viewed through a spectrum of administrative lenses over the past few centuries, ranging from subsistence to extraction in the past, to sustainability, conservation, and climate action in the present.</p>
                    <p>“The British brought with them the ideals of western industrialization which championed private property and flourished on resource-extraction. </p>
